# Patrick Brown News App

## Overview
    Grab articles by topic so you can stay informed


## How to Run
I tried to host it on Heroku or Github Pages. The basic level of the NewsAPI doesn't allow that. On download, run "npm install" then "npm start". Go to http://localhost:3000/ if it doesn't automatically start up for you
